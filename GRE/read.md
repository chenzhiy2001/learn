从文字中剥离逻辑关系

直接加强论点是最强的。加强论据和论点论据的联系次之，对多个论据中的其中一个进行加强则更弱。有时只加强其中一个论据。逻辑路径最短的相对最强

Due to environmental regulations functioned before the 1980s, there was no toxic metals in the batteries manufactured at that time. So they will not affect the environment even the liquids leaked to the underground water.

Modern landfills have protections so that toxic liquids will not leak outside of the landfill.

Unlike earlier batteries, batteries in the 1980s did not contain any liquid.

First of all, the author denotes recent reports about global warming causing the sea ice to melt without specifying how severe the situations are right now. Since the deers tend to choose habitats that is cold enough for ice to appear in some period of the year, as long as there is still ice appearing on the sea during cold times, the deers can always move to a habitat where ice still exist. This means that if only a small part of the ice is melted, the deers can still find a place where ice is sufficient to form a travel route acrossing the islands without any issues, hence the deers' avtivities like harvesting or socializing will not be affected. Evidences in recent decades shows that the harvesting and socializing avtivities of deers has direct relation with their population, so if only some parts of the ice is melted, they can still travel across islands, hunting and breeding just the same as before, their their population will not decrease.

Moreover, simulations done by many research institutions have consistently shown that even if almost all ice in Canadian arctic areas are melted, causing the deers unable to move elsewhere, the amount of deers will stay stablely for decades before decreasing since they travel across the islands for finding food to feed more children, but foods in their own islands is already sufficient for them to breed and feed 2-3 children, which makes their population not declining. The actual reason of deer population declining is a mixture of many factors such as hunting, according to them. By analyzing the data of registered hunters in the arctic areas provided by local governments, they find that not only the amount of hunters are rapidly increasing, their hunting target has changed from other animals to deers in recent years due to higher demand of deer products from the international market. However, the local governments' hunting management departments wrongly calculated the growing speed of deers' amount, causing the number of deers allowed to be killed by hunters exceeding their actual growing speed, making the pupolation of deers decreasing. What's worse is that those adverse factors like over-hunting have immediate effect on deers' disappearing, comparing with ice melting's long term impact. So ice melting is not the main reason why deer population is declining.

作业：写作文第一篇，改这次和之前的作文

First of all, according to researches done by many institutions, the Brim River changed its track tremendously by an earthquake happened after the prehistoric period mentioned in the given article. Scientists have also found the relic of the Brim river's old track which is far away from both Palea and Lithos. Therefore, it is highly possible that there was not a river dividing two villages when they were thriving, so people can travel between the two villages without the hassle of going across a deep, broad river and Lithos people can go to Palea simply by foot and buy Palean baskets. Archaeologists also found that the Palean basket making tools which produce the distinctive pattern were always found in hidden places like cellars in Palea while there were no such tools found in Lithos, meaning that Palean people purposely kept their basket making technique in secret so that Lithos people can only get Palean baskets by trade, rather than copying Palean crafting methods and producing the basket by their own. 

Secondly, the given argument has a big flaw even if the river was acrossing the two villages during prehistoric times. Because boats are used for transporting on water, people usually kept their boats on the riverside so that they don't need to carry boats for a long distance when they want to use it, which causing the boats very likely to be flushed by the deep, broad river during disasters like floods. So boats may exist in those villages in prehistoric times, but all of them were flushed to the downstream later.

这篇老师说没太大问题。逻辑漏洞都堵死了。我觉得就是逻辑要严谨不能跳跃，事情一步一步说明白，上下句的“场景”是有联系的能衔接上的。好在GRE这种考的都是具体的事情，比较好想象场景，不像高考语文作文，考抽象的话题。

补充的观点不能叫做反对，怀疑。但也不是完全支持。


用英文去理解

长阅读永远先看“大意”

会出现“否定他的肯定”，“部分赞成他的否定”等等情况。


nothing A but B => B好.
A rather than B => A好.
A is no better than B => A,B 两个都差

间接关系无法作为条件

复合结果的评价：复合结果中的每一个结果都只能被加强或保持不变，不能被削弱

非A有两种：1）主体的对立面或组成部分 2）关系的否定

作业： 补充作文理论内容

超文本论证：本来有A->B，增加A->C，然后C似乎->B（但是没明说）
超文本论证是不对的

长阅读不好是因为结构题不会做，因为扎在定义里面，不理解句子在文段中起到的作用。所以应该多做结构题，这样长阅读的短板也会补上。
