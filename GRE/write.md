REAL ESTATE COMPARISON

> "Of the two leading real estate firms in our town — Adams Realty and Fitch Realty — Adams Realty is clearly superior. Adams has 40 real estate agents; in contrast, Fitch has 25, many of whom work only part-time. Moreover, Adams' revenue last year was twice as high as that of Fitch and included home sales that averaged $168,000, compared to Fitch's $144,000. Homes listed with Adams sell faster as well: ten years ago I listed my home with Fitch, and it took more than four months to sell; last year, when I sold another home, I listed it with Adams, and it took only one month. Thus, if you want to sell your home quickly and at a good price, you should use Adams Realty."

> Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

The author gives his advice on which of two local real estate firm to use to his friend in a letter. He states that Adams Realty is better than Fitch Realty in terms of agent figure, annual revenue and selling speed, so he recommends his friend to sell his house by Adams. **But his assumptions does not suffice his arguments, making Fitch not an unfeasible choice.**

In order to show that Adam is superior, he states that Adam has 40 agents while fitch has just 25 with many working part-time, but having more employees does not suffice that selling house there is better, because it is possible that Fitch Realty has stricter requirement on its employees' performance so that they only keep elites of the industry, while Adams has more below-the-average agents in terms of selling speed and price, making choosing Fitch better since it is the competence of sellers themselves that determines selling speed and price(这句最好放句首).

版本一：
The author also mentioned that Adams' yearly home sales revenue last year is higher than that of Fitch's, which, in my opinion, is still not a reasonable motivation to recommend Adam because revenue does not equal to clients' benefits, since if Adams cut corners in their service, then Adams will have lower cost while maintaining same income, thus having significantly higher income than their competitor. Therefore, Adams might obtain their higher annual revenue by transfering some fees that is usually paid by the company, such as tax or commission, to the customer, making selling houses at Adams costing more than Fitch.

版本二（没写好）：
The author also mentioned that Adams' yearly home sales revenue last year is higher than that of Fitch's, which, in my opinion, is not a reasonable motivation to recommend the friend selling the house at Adam because he does not provide how much houses each company has sold during the last year. If Adams selling significantly higher amount of houses than Fitch while their annual house sale revenue does not differ too much, then Fitch's average sale prive per house will be higher than that of Adam,（这里不一定=>。但是要讲清楚很麻烦） making Fitch the feasible choice.

所以可以加入经济学知识：需求供给关系 比较优势 替代效应 边际效应

Finally, the author gives his own experience of selling houses on both real estate firms, recommending selling houses in Adams. However, since the house selling market influctuates quite a lot, the Fitch's agents may hold the house for a longer period than Adam, waiting for the highest price to sell. In this case, selling at Fitch brings more benifit to consumers.
