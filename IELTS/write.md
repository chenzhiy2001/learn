## work-life balance
With the development of society, there is a trend that an increasing number of workers want work-life balance but few of them has achieved this goal. This essay will discuss the underlying causes of this phenomenon and suggest some solutions.

There are several reasons why the number of workers who fail to achieve a work-life balance is on the rise. One of the reasons is overworking. With more people looking for jobs, employers may raise their expectations to their empoyees, such as working long hours. Those who want to be employed are more likely to obey this rule. This is particularly the case in the IT industry. 

Another reason is low working efficiency. Employees whose working capacity is below the average are often forced to sacrifice their leisure time in order to finish the given task before deadlines, causing them working overtime. In addition, with the dev of tech, mobile phones, computers and the Internet have been invented. As a result, people can finish their assignments via online conferencing and emailing, no matter where they are, which will occupy their private time, such as weekends and holidays.

## junk food

Governments should levy heavier taxes on junk food so that people will buy less junk food even decrease their frequency of buying unhealthy foods.

## cars

With the development of economies in different countries, an increasing number of customers buy and use their own cars for commute and travel purposes. I would argue that there are far more drawbacks compared with benefits.

The advantage of personal cars is obviously its convenience. For example, car owners can hop on their cars and travel to everywhere whenever they want with their friends and family, but those who only use public transportations need planning ahead about their time and routes by scrutinize on timetables given by subways and busses companies.

Despite the positive mentioned above, I believe that it is a negative development for various reasons, especially cars' impact on the environment. Currently the majority of cars used by customers are still run by fossil fuel, which causes significant pollution in recent decades. Although electric cars like Tesla has been spotted on roads more often than before, their source of energy still relies on burning coal, which still cause significant environmental problems.

In conclusion, Although car owners enjoyed convenience, I still think that buying and using own cars should not be encouraged because environmental problems caused by cars affects not just car owners but everyone.

## studying abroad

Admittedly, the main drawback is financial burdon. Comparing with students studying in their own country, international students have to pay more for a chance to study abroad. They not only need tuition fees and living costs but also extra application fees and transportation fees, which are especially cumbersome for first year students. Luckily, this can be eliviated by having a part-time job for students who have enough free time or by applying for a scholarship for students with outstanding academic performance.

This is particularly the case among students in poverty.

## students studying at home
Students should be away from home when they are studying at university rather than living at home. To what extent do you agree or disagree? --- 写驳论的内容；全篇写作

The argument in favor of students living at home would be that their parents may help them with their housework so that students may concentrate on studying. However, I believe this to be a very shortsighted view. The aim of going to a university is to become accustomed to the society, so students should not only spend time studying but also practicing life skills such as cleaning their house and managing their time independently so that they will switch to working smoothly. Therefore students should move out and live on their own.

## tourism

Admittedly, tourists does bring certain amount of negative impact to the environment. 

However, I don't think that the local culture will be damaged by the development of tourism.
