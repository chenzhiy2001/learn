改写题目
The charts illustrates energy consumption and resulting greenhouse gas emmisions in an common Australian household caused by various family activities. 

概述归纳（巨大不同
Overall, it is obvious from the charts that there is a great difference in the distribution of energy usage and gas emmisions. The most significant feature in those graphs is that energy usages such as refrigeration, lighting, cooling and other appliances account for twice portion in gas emissions comparing to energy use. For example, the category of "other appliances" takes 15% in the first graph but almost doubled (28%) in the second graph.

排序（避免流水账
While heating dominates 42% which is almost half of energy use but only takes a small portion (15%) of greenhouse gas emissions, water heating's portion shows no significant difference in both graphs, which occupies roughly a third of both Australian household energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.
